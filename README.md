### Tutorial from https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-vue

-   We make an app to display employee name, email and company name.
-   Implement CRUD: Update, Delete, Add an employee;
-   Use REST: retrieve data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users, POST a new employee, DELETE an employee, PUT (update) employee. These actions are not persisted there.
-   Use 'Primitive', a css library by Tania Rascia.
